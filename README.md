# 🏨 Airbnb NYC SQL Analysis Project

Welcome to my **Airbnb NYC 2019 Data Analysis** project!  
This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to clean, analyze, and extract business insights from real-world datasets.  
The analysis simulates how data analysts help drive decisions in the short-term rental market using structured queries and data storytelling.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

- Analyze over **49,000 Airbnb listings** in NYC using **SQL**
- Clean and prepare the dataset for reliable analysis
- Engineer new features to enhance insights
- Answer **15 business questions** related to pricing, availability, host behavior, and neighborhood trends
- Develop data-driven recommendations to support strategic decisions

---

## 🧠 Skills Applied

- **SQL Queries**: SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, LIMIT
- **Joins**: INNER JOIN across related tables
- **Aggregations**: COUNT, AVG, SUM, FLOOR
- **Window Functions**: `RANK()` for host ranking
- **CTEs**: Simplify complex queries
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, outliers, unrealistic values
- **Feature Engineering**: New columns for `price_category`, `review_month`, `host_popularity`
- **Business Insight Writing**: Translate query output into real-world insights

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

✔ Checked and confirmed proper data types  
✔ Handled `NULL` values in `reviews_per_month` and `last_review`  
✔ Removed unrealistic prices and minimum_nights entries  
✔ Standardized text columns (case + whitespace issues)  
✔ Created new columns to support deeper analysis

## 🔍 Business Questions Answered

Some of the 15 questions answered using SQL:

1. 🏘 Total listings per neighborhood group  
2. 💲 Average price by room type and neighborhood  
3. 🧑‍💼 Top hosts by number of listings  
4. 🏆 Estimated top-earning hosts  
5. 🗓 Availability patterns across listings  
6. 🛏 Most expensive neighborhoods by room type  
7. 📈 Relationship between price and reviews  
8. 🧾 Duplicate listings check  
9. 📊 Revenue-based ranking using `RANK()` and CTEs

## 📊 Key Insights

- **80%** of listings are in **Manhattan** and **Brooklyn**
- Some hosts manage over **300 listings**, indicating commercial operations
- Lower-priced listings receive **more reviews**, showing stronger demand
- Premium neighborhoods include **Tribeca**, **SoHo**, and **Riverdale**
- Most listings are active for **<30 days/year**, suggesting part-time hosts
